##What is Hexo Blog Encrypt
> Think about this, you write an article, but not want everyone to read. So you will add a passwrod on the blog, others need to answer the password to access the blog.
> It is easy on wordpress or emlog or other blog system. However, when you on hexo, there is no such a plugin or function before.
> Now let me introduce my plugin "Hexo-Blog-Encrypt".
